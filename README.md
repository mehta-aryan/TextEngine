## 💡 Usage

### Interactive Demo

<details>
<summary><b>📝 Autocomplete Example</b></summary>

```
Choice: 1

Enter prefix: alg

--- Results ---
Suggestions for 'alg':
  1. algorithm (freq: 980) ⭐

Select a suggestion (1-1) or 0 to skip: 1
Selected: algorithm (new freq: 981)
Time: 45 μs ⚡
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🔎 Spell Check Example</b></summary>

```
Choice: 2

Enter word: algoritm

✗ Not found

Did you mean:
  1. algorithm
  2. algorithmic
  3. algorithmically

Select a suggestion (1-3) or 0 to add 'algoritm' to dictionary: 1
Selected: algorithm (new freq: 982)
Time: 3 ms
```

</details>

### Dictionary Format
Create a `dictionary.txt` file with words and their frequencies:
```
algorithm 980
autocomplete 750
python 930
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### 🌲 Trie Data Structure
Efficient prefix-based word retrieval using a tree structure where each node represents a character.

```
        root
       /  |  \
      a   b   c
     /    |    \
   l     o     a
  /      |      \
 g      o       t
```

### 📏 Levenshtein Edit Distance
Calculates minimum operations (insert/delete/substitute) to transform one word to another.

**Space Optimized**: Uses only 2 rows instead of full matrix - O(min(m,n)) space complexity!

---

## ⚡ Performance

| Operation | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| **Insert** | O(m) | O(1) |
| **Search** | O(m) | O(1) |
| **Autocomplete** | O(p + n) | O(n) |
| **Spell Check** | O(k × m × n) | O(m) |

*where m = word length, n = matching words, p = prefix length, k = max edit distance*
